1. **Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS):**
   Symptoms: Numbness, tingling, and weakness in the hand due to compression of the median nerve in the wrist.
   Treatment: Rest, wrist splints, medications, and in severe cases, surgery.

2. **Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA):**
   Symptoms: Joint pain, swelling, and stiffness, often affecting the hands and wrists.
   Treatment: Medications, physical therapy, and in some cases, surgery.

3. **Wrist Arthroplasty:**
   Description: Surgical procedure involving the replacement of the wrist joint with an artificial joint.
   Purpose: To relieve pain and improve function, often used in cases of severe arthritis.

4. **Swan Neck Deformity:**
   Description: Deformity of the finger, characterized by hyperextension of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and flexion of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint.
   Treatment: Varied and may include splints, exercises, or surgery depending on severity.

5. **Leprosy:**
   Symptoms: Skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness.
   Treatment: Multi-drug therapy (MDT) is effective in curing leprosy.

6. **Frozen Shoulder (Adhesive Capsulitis):**
   Symptoms: Gradual onset of shoulder pain and stiffness, limiting range of motion.
   Treatment: Physical therapy, medications, and in some cases, joint distension or surgery.
